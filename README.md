# SimpleLinearRegression_Stress-Depression

Developed a simple linear regression model.𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐬.
Here are the key features of the model:

• I generated pseudo-random data with four feature variables:
  1. Lack of Work-Life Balance
  2. Financial Constraints
  3. Sleeplessness
  4. Unhealthy Diet

• Each input variable was rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the best and 10 the worst.

• Exploratory Data Analysis showed these correlations between the features and the target variable:
  1. Lack of Work-Life Balance (0.96)
  2. Financial Constraints (0.93)
  3. Sleeplessness (0.96)
  4. Unhealthy Diet (0.83)

• The Model Evaluation resulted in an R² score of 0.95, meaning 95% of the variability in stress and depression is explained by the feature variables. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 0.1369, indicating quite accurate predictions.
Overall, the high R² and low MSE suggest that the model captures the underlying trends well.
